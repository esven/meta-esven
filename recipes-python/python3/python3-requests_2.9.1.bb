SUMMARY = "Python HTTP for Humans"
DESCRIPTION = "Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely \
verbose and cumbersome. Pythonâ€™s builtin urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP \
capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly broken. It requires an \
enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks."
